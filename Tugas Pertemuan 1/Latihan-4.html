	<h1> The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to <br>
        Learn in 2022 </h1>
	<p>There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The <span style="color: red;">
        U.S. Bureau of  <br> Labor Statistics</span>
        projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is <br>
        more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a <br>
        software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. <br>
        workers.</p>

    <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of <br>
        software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often <br>
        beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming <br>
        can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming <br>
        experience.</p>

    <p>The <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" > Master of Science in Computer Science </span> 
        Align program at Northeastern University is <br>
        specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another <br>
        field of study.
        </p>

     <p style="text-align: center;"> <i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of dif erent backgrounds and have them come <br>
        out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer <br>
        science programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. “We focus on math, programming, and a <br>
        variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</i></p>   

     <p style="text-align: right;">Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know <br>
        which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages <br>
        of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average <br>
        annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.</p>
